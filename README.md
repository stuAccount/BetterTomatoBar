### üìå An Ideal Pomodoro for Reference

The **textbook Pomodoro Technique** consists of:

- **25 minutes** of focused work  
- **5 minutes** short break  
- After **4 work sessions**, take a **15‚Äì30 minute long break**  
- One full cycle ‚âà 2 hours

This structure is great for maintaining stamina, while the custom version above supports longer deep work sessions.
